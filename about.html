                        Hello! My name is Anastasiia Udovenko, and I was born on October 23, 2002, in the charming town of Novomoskovsk, Ukraine. My journey into the world of performance arts began early. At the age of six, I started school, where I quickly discovered a passion for choreography and drawing, attending additional classes to hone my skills.

A year later, my fascination with the circus led me to join the children's circus studio "Melange-art" in Novomoskovsk. This experience was transformative, and in 2016, as part of a talented group of neon jugglers, I had the thrilling opportunity to become a finalist on "Ukraineâ€™s Got Talent. Kids."

From 2017 to 2018, I expanded my horizons by working as a juggler and ballet dancer with the renowned Ukrainian circus "Kobzov." This period was incredibly enriching and solidified my love for the circus arts.

In 2018, I took a significant step in my professional development by enrolling in the Kiev Municipal Academy of Circus and Performing Arts. I successfully graduated as a Junior Specialist and, in 2021, embarked on a Bachelor's degree. My studies have been comprehensive, covering juggling, contortion with hoops, acting, pantomime, and both classical and modern choreography.

This is just the beginning of my adventure in the performing arts, and I am excited to see where this journey takes me next!
